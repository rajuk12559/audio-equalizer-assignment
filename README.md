# audio-equalizer-assignment
A real-time circular audio equalizer that captures microphone input, visualizes audio frequencies using the Web Audio API and Canvas, and streams audio data to a Spring Boot WebSocket backend. The backend sends real-time transcription responses (mocked) and is designed for easy integration with the Gemini speech-to-text API.
